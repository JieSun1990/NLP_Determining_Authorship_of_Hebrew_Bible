Deu1_1,Deu," These [be] the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red [sea], between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.",0
Deu1_2,Deu, ([There are] eleven days' [journey] from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.),0
Deu1_3,Deu," And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first [day] of the month, [that] Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;",1
Deu1_4,Deu," After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:",1
Deu1_5,Deu," On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,",0
Deu1_6,Deu," The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:",1
Deu1_7,Deu," Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all [the places] nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.",0
Deu1_8,Deu," Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.",0
Deu1_9,Deu," And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:",0
Deu1_10,Deu," The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye [are] this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.",0
Deu1_11,Deu," (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye [are], and bless you, as he hath promised you!)",0
Deu1_12,Deu," How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?",0
Deu1_13,Deu," Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.",0
Deu1_14,Deu," And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken [is] good [for us] to do.",0
Deu1_15,Deu," So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.",0
Deu1_16,Deu," And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your brethren, and judge righteously between [every] man and his brother, and the stranger [that is] with him.",0
Deu1_17,Deu," Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; [but] ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment [is] God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring [it] unto me, and I will hear it.",0
Deu1_18,Deu, And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.,0
Deu1_19,Deu," And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.",0
Deu1_20,Deu," And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.",0
Deu1_21,Deu," Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up [and] possess [it], as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.",0
Deu1_22,Deu," And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.",0
Deu1_23,Deu," And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:",1
Deu1_24,Deu," And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.",0
Deu1_25,Deu," And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought [it] down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, [It is] a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.",0
Deu1_26,Deu," Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:",0
Deu1_27,Deu," And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.",0
Deu1_28,Deu," Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people [is] greater and taller than we; the cities [are] great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.",0
Deu1_29,Deu," Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.",0
Deu1_30,Deu," The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;",1
Deu1_31,Deu," And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.",0
Deu1_32,Deu," Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,",0
Deu1_33,Deu," Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents [in], in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.",0
Deu1_34,Deu," And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,",0
Deu1_35,Deu," Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,",0
Deu1_36,Deu," Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.",0
Deu1_37,Deu," Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.",0
Deu1_38,Deu," [But] Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.",0
Deu1_39,Deu," Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.",0
Deu1_40,Deu," But [as for] you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.",0
Deu1_41,Deu," Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.",0
Deu1_42,Deu," And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I [am] not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.",0
Deu1_43,Deu," So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.",0
Deu1_44,Deu," And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, [even] unto Hormah.",0
Deu1_45,Deu," And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.",0
Deu1_46,Deu," So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode [there].",0
Deu2_1,Deu," Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.",0
Deu2_2,Deu," And the LORD spake unto me, saying,",0
Deu2_3,Deu, Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.,0
Deu2_4,Deu," And command thou the people, saying, Ye [are] to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:",1
Deu2_5,Deu," Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau [for] a possession.",0
Deu2_6,Deu," Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.",0
Deu2_7,Deu, For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God [hath been] with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.,0
Deu2_8,Deu," And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.",0
Deu2_9,Deu," And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land [for] a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot [for] a possession.",1
Deu2_10,Deu," The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;",1
Deu2_11,Deu," Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.",0
Deu2_12,Deu," The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.",0
Deu2_13,Deu," Now rise up, [said I], and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.",0
Deu2_14,Deu," And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, [was] thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.",0
Deu2_15,Deu," For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.",0
Deu2_16,Deu," So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,",0
Deu2_17,Deu," That the LORD spake unto me, saying,",0
Deu2_18,Deu," Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:",0
Deu2_19,Deu," And [when] thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon [any] possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot [for] a possession.",1
Deu2_20,Deu, (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;,1
Deu2_21,Deu," A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:",0
Deu2_22,Deu," As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:",1
Deu2_23,Deu," And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, [even] unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)",0
Deu2_24,Deu," Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess [it], and contend with him in battle.",0
Deu2_25,Deu," This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations [that are] under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.",0
Deu2_26,Deu," And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,",0
Deu2_27,Deu," Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.",0
Deu2_28,Deu," Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;",1
Deu2_29,Deu," (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.",0
Deu2_30,Deu," But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as [appeareth] this day.",0
Deu2_31,Deu," And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.",0
Deu2_32,Deu," Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.",0
Deu2_33,Deu," And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.",0
Deu2_34,Deu," And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:",0
Deu2_35,Deu," Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.",0
Deu2_36,Deu," From Aroer, which [is] by the brink of the river of Arnon, and [from] the city that [is] by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:",1
Deu2_37,Deu," Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, [nor] unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.",0
Deu3_1,Deu," Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.",0
Deu3_2,Deu," And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.",0
Deu3_3,Deu," So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.",0
Deu3_4,Deu," And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.",0
Deu3_5,Deu," All these cities [were] fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.",0
Deu3_6,Deu," And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.",0
Deu3_7,Deu," But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.",0
Deu3_8,Deu," And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that [was] on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;",1
Deu3_9,Deu, ([Which] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;),0
Deu3_10,Deu," All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.",0
Deu3_11,Deu," For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead [was] a bedstead of iron; [is] it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits [was] the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.",0
Deu3_12,Deu," And this land, [which] we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which [is] by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.",0
Deu3_13,Deu," And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, [being] the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.",0
Deu3_14,Deu," Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.",0
Deu3_15,Deu, And I gave Gilead unto Machir.,0
Deu3_16,Deu," And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, [which is] the border of the children of Ammon;",1
Deu3_17,Deu," The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast [thereof], from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, [even] the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.",1
Deu3_18,Deu," And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all [that are] meet for the war.",0
Deu3_19,Deu," But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, ([for] I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;",1
Deu3_20,Deu," Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and [until] they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and [then] shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.",0
Deu3_21,Deu," And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.",0
Deu3_22,Deu, Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.,0
Deu3_23,Deu," And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,",0
Deu3_24,Deu," O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God [is there] in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?",1
Deu3_25,Deu," I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that [is] beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.",0
Deu3_26,Deu," But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.",0
Deu3_27,Deu," Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold [it] with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.",0
Deu3_28,Deu," But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.",0
Deu3_29,Deu, So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.,0
Deu4_1,Deu," Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do [them], that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.",0
Deu4_2,Deu," Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish [ought] from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.",0
Deu4_3,Deu," Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.",0
Deu4_4,Deu, But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God [are] alive every one of you this day.,0
Deu4_5,Deu," Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.",0
Deu4_6,Deu," Keep therefore and do [them]; for this [is] your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation [is] a wise and understanding people.",0
Deu4_7,Deu," For what nation [is there so] great, who [hath] God [so] nigh unto them, as the LORD our God [is] in all [things that] we call upon him [for]?",0
Deu4_8,Deu," And what nation [is there so] great, that hath statutes and judgments [so] righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?",0
Deu4_9,Deu," Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;",0
Deu4_10,Deu," [Specially] the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and [that] they may teach their children.",0
Deu4_11,Deu," And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.",0
Deu4_12,Deu," And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only [ye heard] a voice.",0
Deu4_13,Deu," And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, [even] ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.",0
Deu4_14,Deu," And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.",0
Deu4_15,Deu, Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day [that] the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:,1
Deu4_16,Deu," Lest ye corrupt [yourselves], and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,",0
Deu4_17,Deu," The likeness of any beast that [is] on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,",0
Deu4_18,Deu," The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that [is] in the waters beneath the earth:",1
Deu4_19,Deu," And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, [even] all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.",0
Deu4_20,Deu," But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, [even] out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as [ye are] this day.",0
Deu4_21,Deu," Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee [for] an inheritance:",1
Deu4_22,Deu," But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.",0
Deu4_23,Deu," Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, [or] the likeness of any [thing], which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.",0
Deu4_24,Deu," For the LORD thy God [is] a consuming fire, [even] a jealous God.",0
Deu4_25,Deu," When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt [yourselves], and make a graven image, [or] the likeness of any [thing], and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:",1
Deu4_26,Deu," I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong [your] days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.",0
Deu4_27,Deu," And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.",0
Deu4_28,Deu," And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.",0
Deu4_29,Deu," But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find [him], if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.",0
Deu4_30,Deu," When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, [even] in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;",1
Deu4_31,Deu," (For the LORD thy God [is] a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.",0
Deu4_32,Deu," For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and [ask] from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been [any such thing] as this great thing [is], or hath been heard like it?",0
Deu4_33,Deu," Did [ever] people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?",0
Deu4_34,Deu," Or hath God assayed to go [and] take him a nation from the midst of [another] nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?",0
Deu4_35,Deu," Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he [is] God; [there is] none else beside him.",0
Deu4_36,Deu," Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.",0
Deu4_37,Deu," And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;",1
Deu4_38,Deu," To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou [art], to bring thee in, to give thee their land [for] an inheritance, as [it is] this day.",0
Deu4_39,Deu," Know therefore this day, and consider [it] in thine heart, that the LORD he [is] God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: [there is] none else.",0
Deu4_40,Deu," Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong [thy] days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.",0
Deu4_41,Deu, Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;,1
Deu4_42,Deu," That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:",0
Deu4_43,Deu," [Namely], Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.",0
Deu4_44,Deu, And this [is] the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:,0
Deu4_45,Deu," These [are] the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt,",1
Deu4_46,Deu," On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:",0
Deu4_47,Deu," And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which [were] on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;",1
Deu4_48,Deu," From Aroer, which [is] by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which [is] Hermon,",0
Deu4_49,Deu," And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.",0
Deu5_1,Deu," And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.",0
Deu5_2,Deu, The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.,0
Deu5_3,Deu," The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, [even] us, who [are] all of us here alive this day.",0
Deu5_4,Deu," The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,",0
Deu5_5,Deu," (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,",0
Deu5_6,Deu," I [am] the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.",0
Deu5_7,Deu, Thou shalt have none other gods before me.,0
Deu5_8,Deu," Thou shalt not make thee [any] graven image, [or] any likeness [of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the waters beneath the earth:",1
Deu5_9,Deu," Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth [generation] of them that hate me,",1
Deu5_10,Deu, And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.,0
Deu5_11,Deu, Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold [him] guiltless that taketh his name in vain.,0
Deu5_12,Deu," Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.",0
Deu5_13,Deu," Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:",0
Deu5_14,Deu," But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of the LORD thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is] within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.",0
Deu5_15,Deu," And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and [that] the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.",0
Deu5_16,Deu," Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.",0
Deu5_17,Deu, Thou shalt not kill.,0
Deu5_18,Deu, Neither shalt thou commit adultery.,0
Deu5_19,Deu, Neither shalt thou steal.,0
Deu5_20,Deu, Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.,0
Deu5_21,Deu," Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any [thing] that [is] thy neighbour's.",0
Deu5_22,Deu," These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.",0
Deu5_23,Deu," And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, [even] all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;",1
Deu5_24,Deu," And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.",0
Deu5_25,Deu," Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.",0
Deu5_26,Deu," For who [is there of] all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we [have], and lived?",1
Deu5_27,Deu," Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear [it], and do [it].",0
Deu5_28,Deu," And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.",0
Deu5_29,Deu," O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!",0
Deu5_30,Deu," Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.",0
Deu5_31,Deu," But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do [them] in the land which I give them to possess it.",0
Deu5_32,Deu, Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.,0
Deu5_33,Deu," Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and [that it may be] well with you, and [that] ye may prolong [your] days in the land which ye shall possess.",0
Deu6_1,Deu," Now these [are] the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do [them] in the land whither ye go to possess it:",1
Deu6_2,Deu," That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.",0
Deu6_3,Deu," Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do [it]; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.",0
Deu6_4,Deu," Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God [is] one LORD:",0
Deu6_5,Deu," And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.",0
Deu6_6,Deu," And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:",0
Deu6_7,Deu," And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.",0
Deu6_8,Deu," And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.",0
Deu6_9,Deu," And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.",0
Deu6_10,Deu," And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,",0
Deu6_11,Deu," And houses full of all good [things], which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;",1
Deu6_12,Deu," [Then] beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.",0
Deu6_13,Deu," Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.",0
Deu6_14,Deu," Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which [are] round about you;",1
Deu6_15,Deu," (For the LORD thy God [is] a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.",0
Deu6_16,Deu," Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted [him] in Massah.",0
Deu6_17,Deu," Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.",0
Deu6_18,Deu," And thou shalt do [that which is] right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,",1
Deu6_19,Deu," To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.",0
Deu6_20,Deu," [And] when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What [mean] the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you?",0
Deu6_21,Deu," Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:",1
Deu6_22,Deu," And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:",0
Deu6_23,Deu," And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.",0
Deu6_24,Deu," And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as [it is] at this day.",0
Deu6_25,Deu," And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.",0
Deu7_1,Deu," When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;",1
Deu7_2,Deu," And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, [and] utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:",1
Deu7_3,Deu," Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.",0
Deu7_4,Deu," For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.",0
Deu7_5,Deu," But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.",0
Deu7_6,Deu," For thou [art] an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that [are] upon the face of the earth.",0
Deu7_7,Deu," The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye [were] the fewest of all people:",1
Deu7_8,Deu," But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.",0
Deu7_9,Deu," Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he [is] God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;",0
Deu7_10,Deu," And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.",0
Deu7_11,Deu," Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.",0
Deu7_12,Deu," Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:",1
Deu7_13,Deu," And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.",0
Deu7_14,Deu," Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.",0
Deu7_15,Deu," And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all [them] that hate thee.",0
Deu7_16,Deu, And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that [will be] a snare unto thee.,0
Deu7_17,Deu," If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations [are] more than I; how can I dispossess them?",0
Deu7_18,Deu," Thou shalt not be afraid of them: [but] shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;",1
Deu7_19,Deu," The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.",0
Deu7_20,Deu," Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.",0
Deu7_21,Deu," Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God [is] among you, a mighty God and terrible.",0
Deu7_22,Deu," And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.",0
Deu7_23,Deu," But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.",0
Deu7_24,Deu," And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.",0
Deu7_25,Deu," The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold [that is] on them, nor take [it] unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it [is] an abomination to the LORD thy God.",0
Deu7_26,Deu," Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: [but] thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it [is] a cursed thing.",0
Deu8_1,Deu," All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.",0
Deu8_2,Deu," And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, [and] to prove thee, to know what [was] in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.",0
Deu8_3,Deu," And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every [word] that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.",1
Deu8_4,Deu," Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.",0
Deu8_5,Deu," Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, [so] the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.",0
Deu8_6,Deu," Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.",0
Deu8_7,Deu," For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;",1
Deu8_8,Deu," A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;",1
Deu8_9,Deu," A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any [thing] in it; a land whose stones [are] iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.",0
Deu8_10,Deu," When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.",0
Deu8_11,Deu," Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:",0
Deu8_12,Deu," Lest [when] thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt [therein];",1
Deu8_13,Deu," And [when] thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;",1
Deu8_14,Deu," Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;",1
Deu8_15,Deu," Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, [wherein were] fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where [there was] no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;",1
Deu8_16,Deu," Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;",1
Deu8_17,Deu," And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of [mine] hand hath gotten me this wealth.",0
Deu8_18,Deu," But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for [it is] he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as [it is] this day.",0
Deu8_19,Deu," And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.",0
Deu8_20,Deu," As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God.",0
Deu9_1,Deu," Hear, O Israel: Thou [art] to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,",0
Deu9_2,Deu," A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and [of whom] thou hast heard [say], Who can stand before the children of Anak!",0
Deu9_3,Deu," Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God [is] he which goeth over before thee; [as] a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.",0
Deu9_4,Deu," Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.",0
Deu9_5,Deu," Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.",0
Deu9_6,Deu," Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou [art] a stiffnecked people.",0
Deu9_7,Deu," Remember, [and] forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.",0
Deu9_8,Deu," Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.",0
Deu9_9,Deu," When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, [even] the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:",1
Deu9_10,Deu," And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them [was written] according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.",0
Deu9_11,Deu," And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, [that] the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, [even] the tables of the covenant.",0
Deu9_12,Deu," And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted [themselves]; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.",0
Deu9_13,Deu," Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it [is] a stiffnecked people:",0
Deu9_14,Deu," Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.",0
Deu9_15,Deu," So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant [were] in my two hands.",0
Deu9_16,Deu," And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, [and] had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.",0
Deu9_17,Deu," And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.",0
Deu9_18,Deu," And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.",0
Deu9_19,Deu," For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.",0
Deu9_20,Deu, And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.,0
Deu9_21,Deu," And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, [and] ground [it] very small, [even] until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.",0
Deu9_22,Deu," And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.",0
Deu9_23,Deu," Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.",0
Deu9_24,Deu, Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.,0
Deu9_25,Deu," Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down [at the first]; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.",0
Deu9_26,Deu," I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.",0
Deu9_27,Deu," Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:",0
Deu9_28,Deu," Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.",0
Deu9_29,Deu," Yet they [are] thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.",0
Deu10_1,Deu," At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.",0
Deu10_2,Deu," And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.",0
Deu10_3,Deu," And I made an ark [of] shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.",0
Deu10_4,Deu," And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.",0
Deu10_5,Deu," And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.",0
Deu10_6,Deu," And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.",0
Deu10_7,Deu," From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.",0
Deu10_8,Deu," At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.",0
Deu10_9,Deu," Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD [is] his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.",0
Deu10_10,Deu," And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, [and] the LORD would not destroy thee.",0
Deu10_11,Deu," And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take [thy] journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.",0
Deu10_12,Deu," And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,",0
Deu10_13,Deu," To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?",0
Deu10_14,Deu," Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens [is] the LORD'S thy God, the earth [also], with all that therein [is].",0
Deu10_15,Deu," Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, [even] you above all people, as [it is] this day.",0
Deu10_16,Deu," Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.",0
Deu10_17,Deu," For the LORD your God [is] God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:",0
Deu10_18,Deu," He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.",0
Deu10_19,Deu, Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.,0
Deu10_20,Deu," Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.",0
Deu10_21,Deu," He [is] thy praise, and he [is] thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.",0
Deu10_22,Deu, Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.,0
Deu11_1,Deu," Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.",0
Deu11_2,Deu," And know ye this day: for [I speak] not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,",0
Deu11_3,Deu," And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;",1
Deu11_4,Deu," And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and [how] the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;",1
Deu11_5,Deu," And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;",1
Deu11_6,Deu," And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that [was] in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:",1
Deu11_7,Deu, But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.,0
Deu11_8,Deu," Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;",1
Deu11_9,Deu," And that ye may prolong [your] days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.",0
Deu11_10,Deu," For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, [is] not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst [it] with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:",1
Deu11_11,Deu," But the land, whither ye go to possess it, [is] a land of hills and valleys, [and] drinketh water of the rain of heaven:",1
Deu11_12,Deu," A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God [are] always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.",0
Deu11_13,Deu," And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,",0
Deu11_14,Deu," That I will give [you] the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.",0
Deu11_15,Deu," And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.",0
Deu11_16,Deu," Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;",0
Deu11_17,Deu," And [then] the LORD'S wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and [lest] ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.",0
Deu11_18,Deu," Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.",0
Deu11_19,Deu," And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.",0
Deu11_20,Deu," And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:",0
Deu11_21,Deu," That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.",0
Deu11_22,Deu," For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;",1
Deu11_23,Deu," Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.",0
Deu11_24,Deu," Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.",0
Deu11_25,Deu," There shall no man be able to stand before you: [for] the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.",0
Deu11_26,Deu," Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;",0
Deu11_27,Deu," A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:",0
Deu11_28,Deu," And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.",0
Deu11_29,Deu," And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.",0
Deu11_30,Deu," [Are] they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?",0
Deu11_31,Deu," For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.",0
Deu11_32,Deu, And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.,0
Deu12_1,Deu," These [are] the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.",0
Deu12_2,Deu," Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:",0
Deu12_3,Deu," And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.",0
Deu12_4,Deu, Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.,0
Deu12_5,Deu," But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, [even] unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:",1
Deu12_6,Deu," And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:",1
Deu12_7,Deu," And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.",0
Deu12_8,Deu," Ye shall not do after all [the things] that we do here this day, every man whatsoever [is] right in his own eyes.",0
Deu12_9,Deu," For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you.",0
Deu12_10,Deu," But [when] ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and [when] he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;",1
Deu12_11,Deu," Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:",1
Deu12_12,Deu," And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that [is] within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.",0
Deu12_13,Deu, Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest:,0
Deu12_14,Deu," But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.",0
Deu12_15,Deu," Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.",0
Deu12_16,Deu, Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.,0
Deu12_17,Deu," Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:",0
Deu12_18,Deu," But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that [is] within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.",0
Deu12_19,Deu, Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.,0
Deu12_20,Deu," When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.",0
Deu12_21,Deu," If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.",0
Deu12_22,Deu," Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat [of] them alike.",0
Deu12_23,Deu, Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood [is] the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.,0
Deu12_24,Deu, Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.,0
Deu12_25,Deu," Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do [that which is] right in the sight of the LORD.",0
Deu12_26,Deu," Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:",0
Deu12_27,Deu," And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.",0
Deu12_28,Deu," Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest [that which is] good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.",0
Deu12_29,Deu," When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;",1
Deu12_30,Deu," Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.",0
Deu12_31,Deu," Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.",0
Deu12_32,Deu," What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.",0
Deu13_1,Deu," If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,",0
Deu13_2,Deu," And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;",1
Deu13_3,Deu," Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.",0
Deu13_4,Deu," Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.",0
Deu13_5,Deu," And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn [you] away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.",0
Deu13_6,Deu," If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which [is] as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;",1
Deu13_7,Deu," [Namely], of the gods of the people which [are] round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the [one] end of the earth even unto the [other] end of the earth;",1
Deu13_8,Deu," Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:",1
Deu13_9,Deu," But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.",0
Deu13_10,Deu," And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.",0
Deu13_11,Deu," And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.",0
Deu13_12,Deu," If thou shalt hear [say] in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,",0
Deu13_13,Deu," [Certain] men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;",1
Deu13_14,Deu," Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, [if it be] truth, [and] the thing certain, [that] such abomination is wrought among you;",1
Deu13_15,Deu," Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that [is] therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.",0
Deu13_16,Deu," And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.",0
Deu13_17,Deu," And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;",1
Deu13_18,Deu," When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do [that which is] right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.",0
Deu14_1,Deu," Ye [are] the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.",0
Deu14_2,Deu," For thou [art] an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations that [are] upon the earth.",0
Deu14_3,Deu, Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.,0
Deu14_4,Deu," These [are] the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,",0
Deu14_5,Deu," The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.",0
Deu14_6,Deu," And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, [and] cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat.",0
Deu14_7,Deu," Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; [as] the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; [therefore] they [are] unclean unto you.",0
Deu14_8,Deu," And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it [is] unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.",0
Deu14_9,Deu, These ye shall eat of all that [are] in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat:,1
Deu14_10,Deu, And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it [is] unclean unto you.,0
Deu14_11,Deu, [Of] all clean birds ye shall eat.,0
Deu14_12,Deu," But these [are they] of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,",0
Deu14_13,Deu," And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,",0
Deu14_14,Deu," And every raven after his kind,",0
Deu14_15,Deu," And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,",0
Deu14_16,Deu," The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,",0
Deu14_17,Deu," And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,",0
Deu14_18,Deu," And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.",0
Deu14_19,Deu, And every creeping thing that flieth [is] unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.,0
Deu14_20,Deu, [But of] all clean fowls ye may eat.,0
Deu14_21,Deu," Ye shall not eat [of] any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger that [is] in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou [art] an holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.",0
Deu14_22,Deu," Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year.",0
Deu14_23,Deu," And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.",0
Deu14_24,Deu," And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; [or] if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:",1
Deu14_25,Deu," Then shalt thou turn [it] into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose:",1
Deu14_26,Deu," And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,",1
Deu14_27,Deu, And the Levite that [is] within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.,0
Deu14_28,Deu," At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay [it] up within thy gates:",1
Deu14_29,Deu," And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which [are] within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.",1
Deu15_1,Deu, At the end of [every] seven years thou shalt make a release.,0
Deu15_2,Deu," And this [is] the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth [ought] unto his neighbour shall release [it]; he shall not exact [it] of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD'S release.",1
Deu15_3,Deu, Of a foreigner thou mayest exact [it again]: but [that] which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;,1
Deu15_4,Deu, Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee [for] an inheritance to possess it:,1
Deu15_5,Deu," Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.",0
Deu15_6,Deu," For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.",1
Deu15_7,Deu," If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:",1
Deu15_8,Deu," But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, [in that] which he wanteth.",0
Deu15_9,Deu," Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.",0
Deu15_10,Deu," Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.",0
Deu15_11,Deu," For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.",0
Deu15_12,Deu," [And] if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.",0
Deu15_13,Deu," And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty:",1
Deu15_14,Deu," Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: [of that] wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.",0
Deu15_15,Deu," And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day.",0
Deu15_16,Deu," And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;",1
Deu15_17,Deu," Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust [it] through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.",0
Deu15_18,Deu," It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant [to thee], in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest.",0
Deu15_19,Deu," All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.",0
Deu15_20,Deu," Thou shalt eat [it] before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.",0
Deu15_21,Deu," And if there be [any] blemish therein, [as if it be] lame, or blind, [or have] any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God.",0
Deu15_22,Deu," Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean [person shall eat it] alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.",0
Deu15_23,Deu, Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.,0
Deu16_1,Deu," Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.",0
Deu16_2,Deu," Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.",0
Deu16_3,Deu," Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, [even] the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.",0
Deu16_4,Deu," And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there [any thing] of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.",0
Deu16_5,Deu," Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:",1
Deu16_6,Deu," But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.",0
Deu16_7,Deu," And thou shalt roast and eat [it] in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.",0
Deu16_8,Deu, Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day [shall be] a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work [therein].,0
Deu16_9,Deu, Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks from [such time as] thou beginnest [to put] the sickle to the corn.,0
Deu16_10,Deu," And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give [unto the LORD thy God], according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:",1
Deu16_11,Deu," And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that [is] within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that [are] among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.",0
Deu16_12,Deu, And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.,0
Deu16_13,Deu," Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:",1
Deu16_14,Deu," And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that [are] within thy gates.",0
Deu16_15,Deu," Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.",0
Deu16_16,Deu," Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:",1
Deu16_17,Deu," Every man [shall give] as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.",0
Deu16_18,Deu," Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.",0
Deu16_19,Deu," Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.",0
Deu16_20,Deu," That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.",0
Deu16_21,Deu," Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.",0
Deu16_22,Deu, Neither shalt thou set thee up [any] image; which the LORD thy God hateth.,0
Deu17_1,Deu," Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God [any] bullock, or sheep, wherein is blemish, [or] any evilfavouredness: for that [is] an abomination unto the LORD thy God.",0
Deu17_2,Deu," If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant,",0
Deu17_3,Deu," And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;",1
Deu17_4,Deu," And it be told thee, and thou hast heard [of it], and enquired diligently, and, behold, [it be] true, [and] the thing certain, [that] such abomination is wrought in Israel:",1
Deu17_5,Deu," Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, [even] that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.",0
Deu17_6,Deu," At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; [but] at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.",0
Deu17_7,Deu," The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put the evil away from among you.",0
Deu17_8,Deu," If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, [being] matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;",1
Deu17_9,Deu," And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:",1
Deu17_10,Deu," And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee:",1
Deu17_11,Deu," According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, [to] the right hand, nor [to] the left.",0
Deu17_12,Deu," And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.",0
Deu17_13,Deu," And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.",0
Deu17_14,Deu," When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that [are] about me;",1
Deu17_15,Deu," Thou shalt in any wise set [him] king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: [one] from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which [is] not thy brother.",0
Deu17_16,Deu," But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.",0
Deu17_17,Deu," Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.",0

Deu17_20,Deu," That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, [to] the right hand, or [to] the left: to the end that he may prolong [his] days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.",0
Deu18_1,Deu," The priests the Levites, [and] all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.",0

Deu18_3,Deu," And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether [it be] ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.",0
Deu18_4,Deu," The firstfruit [also] of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.",0

Deu18_20,Deu," But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.",0
Deu18_21,Deu," And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?",0
Deu18_22,Deu," When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that [is] the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, [but] the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.",0

Deu19_3,Deu," Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.",0
Deu19_4,Deu," And this [is] the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;",1
Deu19_5,Deu," As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:",0
Deu19_6,Deu," Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he [was] not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.",0
Deu19_7,Deu," Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.",0

Deu20_2,Deu," And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,",1
Deu20_3,Deu," And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;",1

Deu20_10,Deu," When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.",0
Deu20_11,Deu," And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, [that] all the people [that is] found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.",0
Deu20_12,Deu," And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:",1

Deu20_18,Deu," That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God.",0
Deu20_19,Deu," When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field [is] man's [life]) to employ [them] in the siege:",1
Deu20_20,Deu," Only the trees which thou knowest that they [be] not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.",0

Deu21_16,Deu," Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit [that] which he hath, [that] he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, [which is indeed] the firstborn:",1
Deu21_17,Deu," But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated [for] the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he [is] the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn [is] his.",0
Deu21_18,Deu," If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and [that], when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:",1
Deu21_19,Deu," Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;",1
Deu21_20,Deu," And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son [is] stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; [he is] a glutton, and a drunkard.",1
Deu21_21,Deu," And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.",0
Deu21_22,Deu," And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:",0
Deu21_23,Deu," His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged [is] accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee [for] an inheritance.",0
Deu22_1,Deu," Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother.",0
Deu22_2,Deu," And if thy brother [be] not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.",0
Deu22_3,Deu," In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.",1

Deu22_26,Deu," But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; [there is] in the damsel no sin [worthy] of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so [is] this matter:",1

Deu29_23,Deu," [And that] the whole land thereof [is] brimstone, and salt, [and] burning, [that] it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:",1
Deu29_24,Deu," Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what [meaneth] the heat of this great anger?",0
Deu29_25,Deu," Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:",0
Deu29_26,Deu," For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and [whom] he had not given unto them:",1
Deu29_27,Deu," And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:",0
Deu29_28,Deu," And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as [it is] this day.",0
Deu29_29,Deu," The secret [things belong] unto the LORD our God: but those [things which are] revealed [belong] unto us and to our children for ever, that [we] may do all the words of this law.",0
Deu30_1,Deu," And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call [them] to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,",0
Deu30_2,Deu," And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;",1
Deu30_3,Deu," That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.",0
Deu30_4,Deu," If [any] of thine be driven out unto the outmost [parts] of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:",1
Deu30_5,Deu," And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.",1
Deu30_6,Deu," And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.",0
Deu30_7,Deu," And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.",0
Deu30_8,Deu," And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.",0
Deu30_9,Deu," And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:",1
Deu30_10,Deu," If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, [and] if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.",0
Deu30_11,Deu," For this commandment which I command thee this day, it [is] not hidden from thee, neither [is] it far off.",0
Deu30_12,Deu," It [is] not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?",0
Deu30_13,Deu," Neither [is] it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?",1
Deu30_14,Deu," But the word [is] very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.",0
Deu30_15,Deu," See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;",0
Deu30_16,Deu," In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.",0
Deu30_17,Deu," But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;",1
Deu30_18,Deu," I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, [and that] ye shall not prolong [your] days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.",0
Deu30_19,Deu," I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, [that] I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:",1
Deu30_20,Deu," That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, [and] that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he [is] thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.",0
Deu31_1,Deu, And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.,0
Deu31_2,Deu," And he said unto them, I [am] an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.",0
Deu31_3,Deu," The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, [and] he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: [and] Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.",0
Deu31_4,Deu," And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.",0
Deu31_5,Deu," And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.",0
Deu31_6,Deu," Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he [it is] that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.",0
Deu31_7,Deu," And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.",0
Deu31_8,Deu," And the LORD, he [it is] that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.",0
Deu31_9,Deu," And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.",0
Deu31_10,Deu," And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of [every] seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,",1
Deu31_11,Deu," When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.",0
Deu31_12,Deu," Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that [is] within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:",0
Deu31_13,Deu," And [that] their children, which have not known [any thing], may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.",0
Deu31_14,Deu," And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.",0
Deu31_15,Deu, And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.,0
Deu31_16,Deu," And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go [to be] among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.",1
Deu31_17,Deu," Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God [is] not among us?",0
Deu31_18,Deu," And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.",0
Deu31_19,Deu," Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.",0
Deu31_20,Deu," For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.",0
Deu31_21,Deu," And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.",0
Deu31_22,Deu," Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.",0
Deu31_23,Deu," And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.",0
Deu31_24,Deu," And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,",0
Deu31_25,Deu," That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,",0
Deu31_26,Deu," Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.",0
Deu31_27,Deu," For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?",0
Deu31_28,Deu," Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.",0
Deu31_29,Deu," For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt [yourselves], and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.",0
Deu31_30,Deu," And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.",0
Deu32_1,Deu," Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.",0
Deu32_2,Deu," My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:",0
Deu32_3,Deu, Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.,0
Deu32_4,Deu," [He is] the Rock, his work [is] perfect: for all his ways [are] judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right [is] he.",0
Deu32_5,Deu," They have corrupted themselves, their spot [is] not [the spot] of his children: [they are] a perverse and crooked generation.",0
Deu32_6,Deu," Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? [is] not he thy father [that] hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?",0
Deu32_7,Deu," Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.",0
Deu32_8,Deu," When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.",0
Deu32_9,Deu, For the LORD'S portion [is] his people; Jacob [is] the lot of his inheritance.,0
Deu32_10,Deu," He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.",0
Deu32_11,Deu," As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:",0
Deu32_12,Deu," [So] the LORD alone did lead him, and [there was] no strange god with him.",0
Deu32_13,Deu," He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;",1
Deu32_14,Deu," Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.",1
Deu32_15,Deu," But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered [with fatness]; then he forsook God [which] made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.",0
Deu32_16,Deu," They provoked him to jealousy with strange [gods], with abominations provoked they him to anger.",0
Deu32_17,Deu," They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new [gods that] came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.",0
Deu32_18,Deu," Of the Rock [that] begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.",0
Deu32_19,Deu," And when the LORD saw [it], he abhorred [them], because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.",0
Deu32_20,Deu," And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end [shall be]: for they [are] a very froward generation, children in whom [is] no faith.",0
Deu32_21,Deu, They have moved me to jealousy with [that which is] not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with [those which are] not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.,0
Deu32_22,Deu," For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.",0
Deu32_23,Deu, I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.,0
Deu32_24,Deu," [They shall be] burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.",0
Deu32_25,Deu," The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling [also] with the man of gray hairs.",0
Deu32_26,Deu," I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:",0
Deu32_27,Deu," Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, [and] lest they should say, Our hand [is] high, and the LORD hath not done all this.",0
Deu32_28,Deu," For they [are] a nation void of counsel, neither [is there any] understanding in them.",0
Deu32_29,Deu," O that they were wise, [that] they understood this, [that] they would consider their latter end!",0
Deu32_30,Deu," How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?",0
Deu32_31,Deu," For their rock [is] not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves [being] judges.",0
Deu32_32,Deu," For their vine [is] of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes [are] grapes of gall, their clusters [are] bitter:",0
Deu32_33,Deu," Their wine [is] the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.",0
Deu32_34,Deu," [Is] not this laid up in store with me, [and] sealed up among my treasures?",0
Deu32_35,Deu," To me [belongeth] vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in [due] time: for the day of their calamity [is] at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.",0
Deu32_36,Deu," For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that [their] power is gone, and [there is] none shut up, or left.",0
Deu32_37,Deu," And he shall say, Where [are] their gods, [their] rock in whom they trusted,",1
Deu32_38,Deu," Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, [and] drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, [and] be your protection.",0
Deu32_39,Deu," See now that I, [even] I, [am] he, and [there is] no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither [is there any] that can deliver out of my hand.",0
Deu32_40,Deu," For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.",0
Deu32_41,Deu," If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.",0
Deu32_42,Deu," I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; [and that] with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.",0
Deu32_43,Deu," Rejoice, O ye nations, [with] his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, [and] to his people.",0
Deu32_44,Deu," And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.",0
Deu32_45,Deu, And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:,0
Deu32_46,Deu," And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.",0
Deu32_47,Deu," For it [is] not a vain thing for you; because it [is] your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong [your] days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.",0
Deu32_48,Deu," And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,",0
Deu32_49,Deu," Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, [unto] mount Nebo, which [is] in the land of Moab, that [is] over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:",0
Deu32_50,Deu," And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:",1
Deu32_51,Deu," Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.",0
Deu32_52,Deu, Yet thou shalt see the land before [thee]; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.,0
Deu33_1,Deu," And this [is] the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.",0
Deu33_2,Deu," And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand [went] a fiery law for them.",0
Deu33_3,Deu," Yea, he loved the people; all his saints [are] in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; [every one] shall receive of thy words.",0
Deu33_4,Deu," Moses commanded us a law, [even] the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.",0
Deu33_5,Deu," And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people [and] the tribes of Israel were gathered together.",0
Deu33_6,Deu," Let Reuben live, and not die; and let [not] his men be few.",0
Deu33_7,Deu," And this [is the blessing] of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help [to him] from his enemies.",0
Deu33_8,Deu," And of Levi he said, [Let] thy Thummim and thy Urim [be] with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, [and with] whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;",1
Deu33_9,Deu," Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.",0
Deu33_10,Deu," They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.",0

Deu33_15,Deu," And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,",0
Deu33_16,Deu," And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and [for] the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let [the blessing] come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him [that was] separated from his brethren.",0
Deu33_17,Deu," His glory [is like] the firstling of his bullock, and his horns [are like] the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they [are] the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they [are] the thousands of Manasseh.",0
Deu33_18,Deu," And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.",1

Deu33_26,Deu," [There is] none like unto the God of Jeshurun, [who] rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.",0
Deu33_27,Deu," The eternal God [is thy] refuge, and underneath [are] the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy [them].",0
Deu33_28,Deu, Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob [shall be] upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.,0
Deu33_29,Deu," Happy [art] thou, O Israel: who [is] like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who [is] the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.",0
